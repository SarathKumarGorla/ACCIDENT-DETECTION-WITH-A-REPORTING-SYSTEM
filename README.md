🚗 Accident Detection System
📌 Overview

The Accident Detection System is a smart solution designed to detect road accidents in real-time and trigger alerts automatically. This project aims to reduce response time in emergencies by notifying authorities, emergency contacts, or nearby hospitals when an accident occurs.

The system uses sensors/data (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, or image/video processing) to detect abnormal motion patterns or crashes. Once an accident is identified, it captures the location and immediately sends an alert.

🎯 Features

✅ Real-time accident detection using sensor data or algorithms

✅ Location tracking with GPS integration

✅ Automatic emergency alerts (SMS/Call/Email/Notification)

✅ User-friendly interface for monitoring and management

✅ Scalable design for integration with IoT and cloud platforms

🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python / JavaScript / C++ (depending on your implementation)

Backend: Node.js / Flask / Django

Database: MongoDB / MySQL

Frontend (if any): React.js / HTML / CSS

Hardware (if used): Arduino / Raspberry Pi / Smartphone Sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, GPS)

APIs/Services: Google Maps API, Twilio API (for SMS), Firebase (for notifications)

🚀 How It Works

The system continuously monitors vehicle motion data.

If abnormal activity (sudden deceleration, collision force, etc.) is detected → the system assumes a possible accident.

The location (GPS coordinates) of the accident is captured.

An alert is sent to pre-configured contacts or emergency services.

(Optional) If false detection occurs, the user can cancel the alert manually.
